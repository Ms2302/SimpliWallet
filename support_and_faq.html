                    Our application achieves the balance between security and the cost to trade and to store cryptocurrency 
                    funds, and maximise the usability of the software.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Security and cost of using the software are both important. A crypto wallet
                    application with good security protects users’ property. More and more people are
                    using cryptocurrency. A survey shows that there are more than 300 million
                    cryptocurrency users nowadays. Chainalysis researchers found that
                    cybercriminals stole $7.8 billion in cryptocurrency from victims. Security becomes
                    important, while it is related to the rights of the large number of users and there is a
                    serious risk of losing their properties. Therefore, developing a reliable and secure
                    desktop cryptocurrency wallet application is essential. Many people trade
                    cryptocurrency to earn money. They need to reduce the cost to maximise the profit.
                    Some of the cost will be spent on the applications that they use to store and trade
                    their funds. A more secure application can cost more, while others can cost less. For
                    example, the secure hardware wallet ‘TREZOR Model T Wallet’ costs $220 while
                    some of the crypto wallet applications are free. Therefore, achieving the balance
                    between security and cost through developing a software that is secure and cost less
                    at the same time is needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Secondly, there is a need to find a way to increase usability. According to Microsoft,
                    usability measures the ease of use of an application software, which is ‘how easy it
                    is to use a product to perform prescribed tasks. The usability of a software is critical,
                    because increasing usability reduces cost of technical support, increases user
                    acceptance and so on. Moreover, while the user acceptance is increased, the users
                    will be more likely to be satisfied with the software, and they may recommend the
                    software to others, so the software gains popularity. Therefore, a software with
                    good usability will be more likely to gain a good reputation and become more
                    successful, so the usability is important. We need to develop software with higher
                    usability. It should be a desktop application and it contains additional features to
                    further increase usability.

                    First of all, our application is going to achieve the balance between security and cost.
                    There are four types of cryptocurrency wallet applications: web, mobile, desktop and
                    hardware. The web wallet is the least secure type, although this kind of application is
                    convenient to use, while the hardware wallet is the most secure type. The web wallet
                    is not secure, because the information such as the private key is kept in the
                    third-party server. The private key that consists of a string of characters acts as the
                    only way for users to access the cryptocurrency property, so it is very important. It is
                    not secure to rely on the third-party server to store the important information, while
                    the vulnerabilities inside the wallet platform provided by the server may cause the
                    leakage of important user data including the private key due to cyber attack. The
                    people who want to securely keep their cryptocurrency need a secure application.
                    Hardware wallets may be considered as a solution. However, implementing the
                    hardware wallet application is the costliest. Therefore, to balance cost and
                    security, there will be the demand for mobile and desktop crypto wallet applications,
                    because they cost less than hardware wallet, and they are more secure than web
                    crypto wallet applications, as they are different from the web application that stores
                    everything on the third-party server. Mobile and desktop applications are designed
                    for different kinds of devices running different operating systems, so they are both
                    needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Secondly, in comparison with hardware wallets, desktop wallets are much easier to 
                    use, so they have higher usability. Using hardware wallets requires many technical 
                    procedures, such as installing the plugin and upgrading firmware, that may be 
                    difficult to remember, especially for new adopters of crypto. Users may need to 
                    spend more time to find these procedures from the Internet. For example, it takes 
                    about 30 minutes for users to get familiar with the whole operation of using a 
                    hardware wallet called TREZOR, and users without basic knowledge may need more 
                    time. The time cost may be even longer if the information about hardware used is 
                    not easily found through searching on the Internet. On the other hand, while users 
                    want to use the desktop applications, they just need to install the software by 
                    following the instructions. The application can be ready for use in a few minutes, and 
                    the process is much simpler. In addition, as a common feature of desktop crypto 
                    wallet applications, our application is going to allow users to create their own 
                    password which is easier to remember for the user in comparison with the key. 
                    The user can use the password to access their account, rather than remembering 
                    the complex private key. In addition to the features that the other applications 
                    commonly have, our application is going to be easier to use for beginners by some 
                    additional features, thus becoming more user-friendly and further increasing 
                    usability. For example, the software is going to provide a good introduction to crypto 
                    asset ownership and management, so beginners can be soon familiar with what they 
                    need to do. Therefore, the desktop wallet applications all have advantages, and our 
                    application is going to be even better because of the additional features.
